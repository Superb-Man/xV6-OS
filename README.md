# xV6-OS
I am loving this sessional course till now.
1.Offline 1 on system call implementation. 
# Offline 1 on Shell
I am very bad in writing shell script
# Offline 2 on system call basic implementation

Implemented 2 system call ------> xv6-risc-V
# Offline 3 on scheduler
Don't know whether I do it correctly or not! The instructors seem confused too
# Offline 4 on IPC-User_threads
Getting a lot of deadlocks and segmentation fault. But understood a lot of things more deeply while doing this offline.
# Offline 5 on Kernel Thread implementaion
Not so robust OS. User's responsibilty to handle the exit() and join() of a thread.If i get time will try to implement this in future.
# Offline 6 on Paging with swap space
Have some little bugs.Will push it solving those in future. Rest of the codes somehow works and it's the hardest challenge i encountered in academic till now!!
